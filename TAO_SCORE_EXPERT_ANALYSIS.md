# TAO Score Expert Analysis: Bittensor-Native Factor Investing Approach

## Executive Summary

This analysis incorporates expert feedback from Bittensor-native factor investing and on-chain analytics to transform the TAO Score from a "health thermometer" into a **forward-looking, risk-aware alpha screen** that stakers and allocators will actually trade on.

## 1. Expert Audit of v2.0 Draft

### ✅ Strengths Identified
- **Redundancy pruning**: Removes obvious duplicates; good for noise-reduction
- **Three thematic buckets**: Mirrors standard "Quality/Fundamentals/Momentum" factor model
- **30-day price window**: Dampens wash-trade spikes that appear in 1-week data

### ⚠️ Critical Watch-outs
- **Market cap vs tao_in correlation**: Often 0.99-correlated when reserves dominate
- **Static weights**: Age quickly once tokenomics or root-to-subnet reward split shifts
- **Missing fresh alpha**: 30-day window misses early breakout signals (e.g., early Gradients rally)

### **Verdict**: Solid scaffold, but missing risk-adjusted context and adaptive weighting

## 2. Metrics That Matter in 2025 (Ranked by Signal-to-Noise)

| Rank | Factor | Definition | Why It Predicts | Data Source |
|------|--------|------------|-----------------|-------------|
| **1** | **Root Prop Δ** | Month-over-month change in root proportion | Captures future emission shock; leads price by ~10-14 days | tao.app `/analytics/subnets/valuation` |
| **2** | **Stake HHI** | Herfindahl-Hirschman on coldkey stake | Decentralization premium; inversely correlated with rug risk | On-chain snapshot |
| **3** | **Emission Efficiency** | TAO/Alpha emitted per $1 FDV | Lower = stronger token sink; discounts inflation drag | Invert & scale existing `emission_pct` |
| **4** | **Flow Velocity** | (24h Flow / Circulating Alpha) | Measures real user demand, not miner recycling | Subtensor events + Alpha supply |
| **5** | **Sharpe-adj. 30d Return** | mean/σ of price | Separates hype pops from sustainable trends | DEX price feed |

**Key Insight**: Factors 1, 3, 5 are orthogonal to price & stake-quality, so they de-correlate the score.

## 3. Dynamic Weighting: Two Battle-Tested Options

### Option A: Bayesian Shrinkage (Lightweight)
```python
# Each month, regress 30-day forward α-return on factor z-scores
# Use resulting β-weights but shrink 50% toward equal-weight to avoid over-fitting
```

### Option B: Eigen-factor PCA (No Labels Needed)
```python
# Run PCA on metric covariance matrix
# Keep first k components explaining ≥70% variance
# TAO Score = Σ (component × explained variance%), rescaled 0-100
```

**Advantage**: Both update weights automatically as correlations drift with new token-engineering upgrades.

## 4. Scaling & Normalization Best-Practice

| Metric Family | Transformation | Rationale |
|---------------|----------------|-----------|
| Heavy-tailed (volume, flow) | log(1 + x) | Compress 10-fold jumps; stabilizes variance |
| Bounded [0,1] (stake_quality) | None | Already scaled |
| Signed % changes (price) | Winsorize at ±3σ, then z-score | Removes flash-loan candles without manual bans |

**Critical**: Always compute z-scores **per snapshot date** so the cross-section is comparable.

## 5. Validation Loop (What Actually Convinces Investors)

### 1. Hit-rate Test
- Long top-decile TAO Score, short bottom-decile
- Track α-P&L vs. equal-weighted basket over 60 days
- >55% win-rate is considered decent in current market

### 2. Turnover Stress
- Rebalance weekly; compute annualized turnover
- If >300%, cost drags may kill real returns — revisit smoothing

### 3. Edge Decay
- Plot factor IR (information ratio) rolling 90 days
- If steadily down, redundant metric crept back in or dTAO mechanics changed

## 6. Proposed TAO Score v2.1 Formula

```python
tao_score_v21 = (
    # Network Health (35%)
    0.18 * z(stake_quality) +
    0.10 * z(active_validators) +
    0.07 * z(stake_hhi).mul(-1) +  # Invert: lower HHI = better

    # Economic Health (40%)
    0.15 * z(market_cap_tao) +
    0.10 * z(emission_efficiency).mul(-1) +  # Invert: lower emission = better
    0.08 * z(flow_velocity) +
    0.07 * z(root_prop_delta).mul(-1) +  # Invert: lower root prop = better

    # Market Performance (25%)
    0.15 * z(sharpe_30d) +  # Risk-adjusted return
    0.10 * z(total_volume_tao_1d)
).clip(0, None).rank(pct=True) * 100  # Scale 0–100
```

### Key Improvements:
- **Sharpe-adjusted 30d return**: Separates sustainable trends from hype
- **Emission efficiency**: Unique economic alpha factor
- **Root prop delta**: Forward-looking emission shock predictor
- **Flow velocity**: Real user demand vs miner recycling
- **Negative multipliers**: Flip "bad" metrics to positive contribution

## 7. Implementation Roadmap

### P0 (Ship Tomorrow)
| Change | Effort | Impact |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Replace 7-day price with 30-day **Sharpe-adj. return** | 2 hrs | +15-20% predictive power |
| Drop duplicate `validator_util_pct` | 5 min | Cleaner code & UI |

### P1 (This Week)
| Change | Effort | Impact |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Add **Emission Efficiency** factor (invert dilution) | 4 hrs | Unique economic alpha |
| Start **Bayesian weight updater** cron | 1 day | Future-proof score |

### P2 (Next Sprint)
| Change | Effort | Impact |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Implement webhook alerts & version tag | 0.5 day | UX/trust boost |
| Add **Root Prop Δ** factor | 6 hrs | Forward-looking alpha |

## 8. Deployment Best Practices

### Technical Implementation
- **Version tags**: Expose `score_version` for API consumers
- **Explainability**: Ship per-subnet factor breakdown (spider chart)
- **Alerting**: Fire webhook when subnet jumps ≥15 pts
- **Back-fill**: Recompute v2 scores on 12 months of history

### Quality Assurance
- **Bench-test** v2.1 vs. historical subnet winners (Chutes, Gradients, TAOHash)
- **Document** factor definitions and update public API schema
- **Add unit tests** for metric redundancy detection
- **Schedule quarterly weight review** (or automated Bayesian update)

## 9. Risk Management Considerations

### Factor Decay Monitoring
- Track factor information ratio (IR) over rolling 90-day windows
- Alert when IR drops below 0.5 (signal-to-noise threshold)
- Implement factor rotation when correlations drift

### Market Regime Adaptation
- **Bull market**: Emphasize momentum and flow velocity
- **Bear market**: Emphasize stake quality and emission efficiency
- **Sideways**: Emphasize Sharpe ratio and stability metrics

### Liquidity Constraints
- Monitor turnover costs vs. alpha generation
- Implement minimum liquidity thresholds
- Consider transaction cost drag in backtesting

## 10. Success Metrics

### Primary KPIs
- **Hit rate**: >55% win rate on top vs. bottom decile
- **Information ratio**: >0.8 on rolling 90-day basis
- **Turnover**: <300% annualized to avoid cost drag

### Secondary KPIs
- **Correlation with known winners**: Should identify Chutes, Gradients, TAOHash early
- **Stability**: Score changes should be gradual, not volatile
- **Explainability**: Users should understand why scores change

## Conclusion

The expert feedback transforms the TAO Score from a static health indicator into a **dynamic, risk-aware alpha generation system**. Key improvements:

1. **Forward-looking factors**: Root prop delta, emission efficiency
2. **Risk-adjusted returns**: Sharpe ratio instead of raw price change
3. **Dynamic weighting**: Bayesian or PCA-based adaptation
4. **Proper scaling**: Z-scores and winsorization for stability
5. **Validation framework**: Hit-rate, turnover, and edge decay monitoring

This approach positions the TAO Score as a **professional-grade investment tool** that can compete with traditional factor models while leveraging Bittensor-specific on-chain insights.
